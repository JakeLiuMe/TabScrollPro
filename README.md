## 🤔 Why Tab Scroll Pro?

Chrome removed the native tab scrolling feature, frustrating millions of users who relied on it. Existing extensions either:
- Don't work reliably
- Have poor UX
- Are bloated with unnecessary features
- Haven't been updated in years

**Tab Scroll Pro is:**
- ✅ Modern (Manifest V3)
- ✅ Fast and lightweight
- ✅ Privacy-respecting (no data collection)
- ✅ Open source
- ✅ Actively maintained

## 🛡️ Privacy

Tab Scroll Pro:
- Does NOT collect any data
- Does NOT make any network requests
- Does NOT track you in any way
- Only requests minimal permissions needed to switch tabs

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Some sites with custom scroll behavior might interfere with the extension
- The modifier key must be held while scrolling (by design, to prevent accidental tab switches)

## 📝 Changelog

### v1.0.0 (2024)
- Initial release
- Mouse wheel tab scrolling with modifier keys
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Customizable settings
- Wrap-around support
